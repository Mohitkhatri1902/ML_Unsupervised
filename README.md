**Project Summary -** The project revolves around analyzing the Indian restaurant industry using data sourced from Zomato, a prominent restaurant aggregator and food delivery platform. By leveraging two key datasets – Zomato restaurant metadata and restaurant reviews – the project aims to gain insights into customer sentiments, segment restaurants into meaningful categories, and provide actionable recommendations for both consumers and Zomato.

The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the datasets and identify potential trends and patterns. Subsequently, clustering techniques will be applied to segment restaurants based on various attributes such as cuisine types, pricing, and customer ratings. This segmentation will enable the identification of distinct restaurant clusters, allowing consumers to make informed choices based on their preferences.

Additionally, sentiment analysis will be performed on the restaurant reviews dataset to gauge customer satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement. By examining the sentiments expressed in reviews, Zomato can gain valuable insights into customer preferences and concerns, enabling them to enhance their services and offerings.

Overall, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the Indian restaurant industry, empower consumers to make informed dining decisions, and support Zomato in improving its platform and services based on customer feedback. Through the combination of data analysis techniques and domain knowledge, the project seeks to contribute to the growth and development of the restaurant industry in India.

**Problem Statement -** The aim of this capstone project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Indian restaurant industry leveraging data obtained from Zomato, a prominent restaurant aggregator and food delivery platform. The project seeks to uncover valuable insights into customer sentiments, segment Zomato restaurants into distinct categories, and derive actionable conclusions to benefit both consumers and the company.

**Objectives:**

Gain insights into customer sentiments by analyzing Zomato restaurant reviews.
Cluster Zomato restaurants based on various factors such as cuisine, cost, and customer ratings.
Provide recommendations to customers for finding the best restaurants in their locality.
Assist Zomato in identifying opportunities for growth and improvement within the industry.

**Conclusion** - In this project, we successfully applied various data preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of our textual dataset, making it suitable for machine learning.

Optimized Clustering: Utilizing K-means clustering, we refined the number of clusters (K) and notably enhanced the Silhouette Score, signaling improved cluster distinction, with K=6 identified as the optimal value.

Topic Modeling: Employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we uncovered key topics within reviews, offering valuable insights into prevalent themes.

Model Performance: After hyperparameter tuning, supervised models like Logistic Regression and XGBoost demonstrated significant enhancements in key evaluation metrics.

Improved Precision: Achieving high precision is crucial for accurate positive sentiment prediction in sentiment analysis tasks, benefiting businesses in interpreting customer sentiment effectively.

Enhanced Recall: Demonstrating high recall ensures effective capture of positive instances, a critical feature in applications where missing positive cases is undesirable.

Balanced F1-Score: Attaining a balanced F1-score strikes a favorable balance between precision and recall, crucial for applications requiring both accuracy and coverage.

Significance of ROC AUC: The improved ROC AUC score post-tuning underscores the model's capacity to differentiate between positive and negative instances, vital for classification accuracy.

Model Deployment: Highlighting the importance of saving the best-performing model in a deployable format, paving the way for real-world implementation.

Future Prospects: Addressing the potential for live server deployment and stressing the importance of evaluating the model on unseen data for real-world validation.

Impact on Business: Emphasizing our project's potential to equip businesses with data-driven insights, enriching decision-making capabilities.

Data Transformation: From text preprocessing to model selection, our project showcases the transformative prowess of data science, converting raw data into actionable knowledge.
